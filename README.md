# CKEditor Bootstrap Tooltip Drupal 8

Drupal 8 CKEditor Plugins for adding Bootstrap Tooltips through the WYSIWYG editor.

###Install Process:

Clone into /drupalroot/modules, then navigate to yoursite.com/admin/modules and activate the module in the GUI.

###Prereqs:

* A Bootstrap-based theme (duh)
* Libraries Module

###Restrictions, WIP stuff:

If HTML restriction is on (i.e. if you try to add this button to a "Basic HTML" text editor style) it will crash the editor window on load, so don't do that. Works completely fine on Full HTML.
